## Description
This project is an API for a social network using a NoSQL database (MongoDB). To build this API and connect to the MongoDB database, I used Mongoose. With this I was able to connect my Express routes with the data being created/stored in the database.

To access the data within the database, start the server with "npm run dev". Then, hit any of the API endpoints to access the data.

## Tools Used
- JavaScript
- Insomnia
- Loom
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Node.js, Express.js, Nodemon
